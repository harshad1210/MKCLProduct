# MKCL Product Project: Operational Manual

This guide explains how to run, manage, and deploy the **MKCL Product Web Application** without using any AI assistance. It is written for non-technical users.

## 🏗️ Part 1: Running the Project Locally (On Your Computer)

This section explains how to start the website on your own laptop for testing or development.

### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed (you likely already do):
1.  **Node.js**: The engine that runs the code.
2.  **VS Code**: The editor to view files (optional but recommended).
3.  **Terminal/Command Prompt**: To type commands.

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

1.  **Open the Project Folder**
    *   Navigate to the folder `D:\Antigravity\MKCLProduct`.
    *   Right-click inside the folder and select "Open in Terminal" (or type `cmd` in the address bar).

2.  **Start the Server**
    *   In the black screen (Command Prompt), type the following command exactly and press **Enter**:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   **What this does**: It prepares the database (`dev.db`) and starts the website engine.

3.  **Access the Website**
    *   You will see a message saying `> Local: http://localhost:3000`.
    *   Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.).
    *   Type `http://localhost:3000` in the address bar.
    *   **Success!** You should see the MKCL Product website running effectively.

### **Troubleshooting Local Issues**
*   **"Port 3000 is in use"**: If you see this error, it means the website is already running in another window. Close other Command Prompt windows and try again.
*   **Database Errors**: If the site fails to load, run this command to "reset" the local database connection:
    ```bash
    npx prisma generate --schema=prisma/schema.local.prisma
    ```
    Then try `npm run dev` again.

## 🚀 Part 2: Deploying to Production (The Live Internet)

This section explains how to update the live website that everyone sees (`https://mkcl-product.vercel.app`).

**⚠️ Caution**: Changes here affect the LIVE website.

### **how it works**
We use a service called **Vercel** to host the website. We use **Vercel Postgres** for the live database.

### **Deployment Process (From Local to Live)**

Follow these steps **only** when you are sure your local changes (on localhost) are working perfectly and tested.

#### **Step 1: Update the Live Database (If needed)**
If you added new tables (like `AuditLog` or `User`), you must tell the live database about them.
1.  Open Command Prompt in `D:\Antigravity\MKCLProduct`.
2.  Type this command:
    ```bash
    npm run db:push:prod
    ```
    *(Note: This sends only the structure, not your local test data).*
3.  Wait for it to say `🚀 Your database is now in sync`.

#### **Step 2: Upload the Code (Git Push)**
1.  In the same Command Prompt, type these commands:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
    git push
    ```
2.  **That's it!** Vercel will automatically detect the change, build the new version, and deploy it.
3.  You can verify the deployment at `https://vercel.com/dashboard`.

## 🔄 Part 3: Switching Between Environments

The project is designed to keep **Local** and **Production** separate automatically.

| Feature | Local (Your PC) | Production (Live Website) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Command** | `npm run dev` | `git push` |
| **Database** | `dev.db` (File on your disk) | Vercel Postgres (Cloud) |
| **File Uploads** | `public/uploads` (Folder on disk) | Vercel Blob (Cloud Storage) |
| **Login Data** | Separate (Test Users) | Separate (Real Admins) |

**You do NOT need to change any code manually to switch.** The commands handle it for you.

## 📋 Cheat Sheet

Save these commands somewhere handy:

1.  **Start Daily Work (Local)**:
    `npm run dev`

2.  **Fix Local Database Issues**:
    `npx prisma generate --schema=prisma/schema.local.prisma`

3.  **Update Live Website Code**:
    `git push`

4.  **Update Live Database Structure**:
    `npm run db:push:prod`
